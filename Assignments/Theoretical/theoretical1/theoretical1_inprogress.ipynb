    "# Tweet classification with naive bayes - Teodor Carlsson\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we are going to implement a naive bayes classifier for classifying tweets about Trump or Obama based on the words in the tweet. Recall that for two events A and B the bayes theorem says\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where P(A) and P(B) is the ***class probabilities*** and P(B|A) is called ***conditional probabilities***. this gives us the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. So as an example if we want to find the probability of \"is this a tweet about Trump given that it contains the word \"president\" \" we will obtain the following \n",

    "\n",
    "This means that to find the probability of \"is this a tweet about Trump given that it contains the word \"president\" \" we need the probability of \"president\" being in a tweet about Trump, the probability of a tweet being about Trump and the probability of \"president\" being in a tweet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly if we want to obtain the opposite \"is this a tweet about Obama given that it contains the word \"president\" \"\n",

    "\n",
    "This gives us:\n",

    "\n",
